        Growing access to information and data is perhaps the most persistent
        theme in modern innovation. In the past 25 years, global access to
        knowledge and information has radically expanded. Spurred by the
        invention of the internet and the web, people across the globe are able
        to publish and consume information in a borderless and unbounded manner.
        Hypertext transfer protocols continuously stream unimaginable volumes of
        information between continents, at near the speed of light.

        But science lags far behind other information ecosystems. Unfortunately,
        science has not benefited from the internet-enabled innovation of the
        past 25 years as greatly as other information ecosystems. Vast troves of
        research remain shielded from the public, largely as a consequence of
        archaic and exploitative publication models. Research also remains hard
        to publish without the approval of sanctioned gatekeepers.

        The "publishing problem" is threefold, spanning a complex cultural,
        legal, and technological landscape. Whether because of a dearth of
        licensing options for openly published research, or inadequate
        technology for decentralized publishing, scientific publishing is
        heavily centralized institution. Though the publishing problem is broad
        and hard to precisely define, one institution can be seen as the source:
        the scientific journal.

      <p className="py-4 leading-7 text-left">
        Scientific journals have a tight monopoly over the means of research
        publication. Entire fields of science are often dominated by a handful
        of journals, and information transfer within the broader scientific
        ecosystem rarely occurs outside of "high-impact journals", which are
        highly competitive and expensive to publish in. Because of their
        dominant position, journals are able to extract payments from
        researchers <em>and</em> readers, in a Kafkaesque (and often
        taxpayer-funded) arrangement.

      <p className="py-4 leading-7 text-left">
        By decentralizing publishing technology and providing a legal model for
        decentralized publishing, the SciPub Foundation hopes to change this.
