        The goals of the SciPub Foundation are so grandiose that they can likely
        never be reached. Their purpose is to serve as a proverbial north star.
        Reliable, unattainable, and If we manage to achieve even 10% of what we
        set out to do, we will change the world. Imagine reaching 10% of the
        speed of light.

        Growing access to information and data is perhaps the most persistent
        theme in modern innovation. In the past 25 years, the world has seen a
        radical shift in the availability and accessibility of information and
        knowledge. Spurred by the invention of the internet and then the web,
        people across the globe are able to publish and consume information in a
        borderless and unbounded manner. Hypertext transfer protocols
        continuously stream unimaginable volumes of information between
        continents, at near the speed of light.

        But science lags far behind other knowledge ecosystems. For a number of
        unfortunate reasons, science has not benefited from the innovation of
        the past 25 years as greatly as other information disciplines have. Vast
        troves of research publications are shielded from the public, largely as
        a consequence of archaic and exploitative publication models. Why is
        this so?
      </p>
      <p className="py-4 text-left leading-7">
        Scientific journals have an astounding monopoly over today's research
        landscape. Entire fields of science are often dominated by a handful of
        journals, and information transfer within the broader scientific
        ecosystem rarely occurs outside of "high-impact journals", which are
        highly competitive and expensive to publish in. Because of their
        dominant position, journals are able to extort publishers <em>and</em>{" "}
        readers, in a Kafkaesque (and often taxpayer-funded) arrangement.

      <p className="py-4 text-left leading-7">
        By decentralizing publishing technology and providing a legal model for
        decentralized publishing, the SciPub Foundation hopes to change this.
